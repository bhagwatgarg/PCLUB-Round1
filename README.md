Question 5: Data Science

As the test set lacks the User_Traffic feature, the predictions for testing data could not be made. I have worked on training and cross validation data to predict the best model. Therefore, I have commented the code required to make predictions on the test data.


Problem Statement:
This problem statement is fairly simple. You will need to perform perfunctory Data Analysis on the Data Sets given.
"Train" sheet conatins cloumns in which the Sales columns is the target variable and others are data inputs as seen in the Test Sheet.
Following parts have to be performed in COLAB or Jupyter Notebooks:-  Importing data,Cleaning data,Splitting it into train/test or cross-validation sets,Pre-processing,Transformations,
Feature selection and Data Analysis.
These terms may seem odd but are quintessential in Exploratory Data Analysis.
Be creative in presenting aspects of Data through visual representation.
Commenting on Important parts is required.
